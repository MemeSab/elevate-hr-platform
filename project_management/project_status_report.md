**Last Updated:** `2026-04-06`
**Overall Project Health:** 🟢 **HEALTHY**

---

## ⚡ Current Status Overview
All foundational branding, authentication, and real-time backend synchronization tasks for the Elevate platform have been successfully completed. Transitions from dark heroes to white sticky headers are now 100% seamless across all sub-pages.

### 🏁 Recently Completed (Phase 3 Finalized)
*   **Global Branding Sync**: Reached 100% fidelity on the navbar logo transitions using dynamic JS `src` swaps. Resolves all "white-on-white" invisibility conflicts.
*   **Navigation Pop**: Implemented vibrant Sky Blue (#38BDF8) for authentication links, synchronized with the active "Home" state.
*   **Sub-Page Continuity**: Enforced `scrolled-page` logic on About, Services, Courses, and Insights to ensure branding is authoritative on first render.
*   **Auth Loop**: Fully functional signup, login, and session persistence.
*   **Dynamic Dashboard**: Hardcoded placeholders replaced with real-time `onSnapshot` listeners.

### 🛠️ Resolved Risks
*   **R-001 (Credential Leak)**: Rotated and secured.
*   **R-002 (Localhost Friction)**: Fixed via automated Python server scripts.
*   **R-005 (Expired API Key)**: Resolved via key rotation and documentation update.

## 🏔️ Upcoming Milestones (Phase 4)
The next focus is **Monetization & Monetization Refinement**.
*   **Stripe Extension Setup**: Configuring the "Run Stripe" extension in the Firebase console.
*   **Course Gating**: Implementing restricted playback logic (15s teasers vs. full access).
*   **Subscription UI**: Building the pricing table and payment success/fail landing pages.

## 🚦 Risk & Blocker Summary
*   **Blockers**: None.
*   **Top Risk**: **R-003 (Video Content Security)**. This is the primary technical hurdle for Phase 4—ensuring that non-paid users cannot bypass the 15-second limit by inspecting direct MP4 URLs. Mitigation strategy involves Firebase Storage rules.
